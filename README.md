=================================================================

This repo contains an example Cordova/Phonegap project which illustrates use of the [SQLite Porter plugin](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-sqlite-porter) with a native SQLite database via this [native SQLite plugin](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage).

# Downloading

To download the example project, clone it using git:

    $ git clone https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-sqlite-porter-example-native-plugin.git

# Building

This project should build and run on any Cordova/Phonegap platform supported by the [native SQLite plugin](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage):

- Android
- iOS
- Amazon Fire-OS
- Windows Universal (8.1)
- Windows Phone 7
- Windows Phone 8

For platforms that support WebSQL in their WebViews, you can use the sqlite-porter plugin without the native SQLite plugin.
There's [another example project](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-sqlite-porter-example) which demonstrates use of the [SQLite Porter plugin](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-sqlite-porter) with a WebSQL database.

For example, to run on the Android platform, execute the following commands from the project root:

- Install the platform to the project: `$ cordova platform add android`
- Build and run the project: `$ cordova run android`
